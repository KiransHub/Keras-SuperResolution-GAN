Keras-SuperResolution-GAN Project
===

# Introduction

I'm currently experimenting with Generative Adverserial Networks (GANS). In an attempt to get to grips with using them in practise I started this example real world project. 

The aim of this project is to reconstruct higher resolution images based on downscaled examples. 

This project is currently work in progress.
